Explosives Mod v0.0.1
=====================
Create TNT-based explosive devices that detonate from excessive pressure, heat,
sound, on timer etc.

Types of mines
--------------
The basic land mine can be created by attaching a fuze to a standard TNT block
(part of the standard subgame, but needs to be enabled in the config). An armed
land mine will detonate if punched or stepped upon, and will explode shortly
after. The mine will explode immediately if touched by a torch. This land mine
can be concealed in dirt or in dirt with grass (see Recipes).

A land mine can be turned into a naval by attaching a vessel (e.g. bottle) and
a reel of cable. An armed naval mine will float under water surface and explode
if approached. A naval mine will start drifting randomly if its cable is broken.

A land mine can also be turned into a time bomb by attaching an hourglass. A
time bomb will explode after a set interval of time (between 1 second and 1
hour).

Arming
------
All mines are created unarmed and can be handled relatively safely (like a TNT
block). After placing, a mine needs to be armed manually (by right-clicking and
pressing the 'Arm the mine' button). It takes 30 seconds, and can be canceled.
After a mine is armed, there is no way to disarm it. Drifting naval mines are
especially dangerous.

A time bomb needs to be armed by setting the time interval (in seconds) and
pressing the 'Set the timer' button. The timer can not be stopped.

Nodebox or mesh models

and as a mesh model. Nodebox is the default. To enable mesh models, add
'enable_explomesh = true' to your config file.
