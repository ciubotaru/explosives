Explosives Mod v0.0.1
=====================
Adding fuzes to TNT blocks makes it possible to create explosive devices that
detonate from excessive pressure, heat or sound.

Types of mines
--------------
The basic land mine can be created by attaching a fuze to a standard TNT block
(part of the standard subgame, but needs to be enabled in the config). An armed
land mine will detonate if punched or stepped upon, and will explode shortly
after. The mine will explode immediately if touched by a torch. This land mine
can be concealed in dirt or in dirt with grass (see Recipes).

A land mine can be turned into a naval by attaching a vessel (e.g. bottle) and
a reel of cable. An armed naval mine will float under water surface and explode
if approached. A naval mine will start drifting randomly if its cable is broken.

Arming
------
All mines are created unarmed and can be handled relatively safely (like a TNT
block). After placing, a mine needs to be armed manually (by right-clicking and
pressing the 'Arm' button). It takes 30 seconds, and can be canceled. After a
mine is armed, there is no way to disarm it. Drifting naval mines are especially
dangerous.
